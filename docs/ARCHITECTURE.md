# Architecture Overview

Bunnify Frontend is a lightweight, **frontend-only** BunnyCDN image-URL rewriter for WordPress.
It does not upload, purge, or store anything on Bunny — it rewrites the URLs WordPress emits so
that `<img>` `src`/`srcset`, downsized sources, galleries, and widget images point at your Bunny
pull zone, optionally with on-the-fly resize query args (`?width=…&height=…`).

- **Runtime:** PHP 8.2+, WordPress 6.3+.
- **Config:** a single option, `bunnify_hostname` (empty ⇒ plugin is inert).
- **Extension surface:** ~20 `bunnify_*` filters/actions — see [HOOKS.md](HOOKS.md).

This page describes the *shipped* plugin under `bunnify-frontend/` (the repo root holds docs and the
dev toolchain, which are **not** shipped). All file references below are relative to the plugin
subdirectory `bunnify-frontend/`.

---

## 1. Bootstrap

The plugin uses a small in-house mini-MVC framework under `src/php/Base`. Boot is a three-step
handoff: entry file → `Base\Main\Application` → controllers on `plugins_loaded`.

```
wp-settings.php loads the plugin
        │
        ▼
bunnify-frontend.php  (entry file)
  1. require build-tools/vendor/autoload.php   (PSR-4 runtime autoloader)
  2. guard: bail if BunnifyFrontend\APP_NAME already defined
  3. define APP_NAME = basename(__DIR__)
  4. new Base\Main\Application( APP_NAME, __DIR__, [ …6 controllers… ] )
        │
        ▼
Base\Main\Application::__construct()
  • load_config()  → new Base\Library\Config( $this ); ->autoload()
  • add_action( 'plugins_loaded', [ $this, 'setup_controllers' ] )
        │
        ▼  (on plugins_loaded)
Application::setup_controllers()   — for each controller:
  • base_pre_controller_set_instances   (filter)
  • set_services_for_controller()       — trait-driven service injection
  • base_post_controller_set_instances  (filter)
  • $controller->set_config_instance( $config )
  • base_pre_controller_set_up          (filter)
  • $controller->set_up()               ← registers this controller's WP hooks
  • base_post_controller_set_up         (filter)
```

Key facts:

- The controller list is declared **in the entry file** (`bunnify-frontend.php:47-58`) and passed to
  `Application`. Order is: `CDNController`, `WPResourceHintsController`, `ContentController`,
  `ImageController`, `RESTController`, `SettingsController`.
- Every controller extends `Base\Main\Controller` (`src/php/Base/Main/Controller.php`) and must
  implement `set_up()` — the single place a controller registers its WordPress hooks
  (`Controller.php:32`, `abstract public function set_up()`).
- **Trait-driven service injection.** `Application::set_services_for_controller()`
  (`src/php/Base/Main/Application.php:124`) inspects the controller's traits — collected recursively
  across parent classes and traits-of-traits by `get_traits_recursive()` — and lazily constructs
  and injects a shared `Route`, `REST`, or `AdminAjax` instance only for controllers that use the
  matching trait (`RouteTrait` / `RESTTrait` / `AdminAjaxTrait`). None of Bunnify's controllers use
  those traits today, so no services are injected — but the mechanism is the framework's substitute
  for a DI container.
- The autoloader is loaded from `build-tools/vendor/autoload.php` (a minimal PSR-4 map that ships in
  the zip), guarded by the `APP_NAME` constant so a double-load (e.g. plugin + bundled dependency)
  is a no-op.

## 2. Directory layout

```
bunnify-frontend/                     ← installable plugin (ships to WordPress.org)
├── bunnify-frontend.php              ← entry file: autoload + boot Application
├── readme.txt                        ← wp.org readme (source of truth for version)
├── uninstall.php                     ← deletes bunnify_* options
├── build-tools/vendor/               ← runtime PSR-4 autoloader (ships)
└── src/php/
    ├── Base/                         ← mini-MVC framework (Main, Library, Traits, Model)
    │   ├── Main/{Application,Controller,View}.php
    │   ├── Library/{Config,Route,REST,AdminAjax}.php
    │   └── Traits/{CachingTrait,DebugTrait,RouteTrait,RESTTrait,…}.php
    ├── Controller/                   ← the 6 controllers (WP hook wiring lives here)
    ├── Library/{URLTransformer,ImageProcessor}.php   ← core logic
    ├── Model/PostType/Attachment.php ← attachment post-type constant
    └── Function/AutoLoad.php
```

`src/php/Base` is deliberately excluded from PHPCS/PHPStan today (it is treated as vendored,
hand-maintained framework code) — this is tracked as debt, see §8.

---

## 3. Controllers

Controllers are plain objects. Each owns a slice of WordPress' rendering pipeline and registers its
hooks in `set_up()`.

| Controller | File | Responsibility | Registers |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CDNController** | `Controller/CDNController.php` | Public entry point for direct URL rewriting; exposes the `bunnify_url` filter. Resolves an attachment ID first (to preserve the *original* filename) and falls back to `URLTransformer::transform_url()`. | `bunnify_url` |
| **ImageController** | `Controller/ImageController.php` | The core image pipeline: single-image downsize, attachment `src` arrays, final `<img>` HTML, and responsive `srcset`/`sizes`. Handles registered sizes, `[w,h]` arrays, and custom `16:9-768`-style aspect-ratio sizes. | `image_downsize`, `wp_get_attachment_image_src`, `wp_get_attachment_image`, `wp_calculate_image_srcset_meta`, `wp_calculate_image_srcset`, `wp_calculate_image_sizes` |
| **ContentController** | `Controller/ContentController.php` | Post-render HTML rewriting for content that isn't produced by the attachment functions: `the_content`, blocks, galleries, and text/media widgets. Uses `WP_HTML_Tag_Processor` and a heuristic (`is_attachment_image()`) to skip images already handled by `ImageController`. | `bunnify_content`, `the_content`, `widget_text`, `get_post_galleries`, `widget_media_image_instance`, `render_block`, `render_block_core/gallery` |
| **WPResourceHintsController** | `Controller/WPResourceHintsController.php` | Adds a `preconnect` resource hint for the Bunny hostname (and strips a duplicate `dns-prefetch`). Skips the hint when the CDN host equals the site host (local/staging/misconfig). | `wp_resource_hints` |
| **SettingsController** | `Controller/SettingsController.php` | Media → **BunnyCDN** admin page. Registers `bunnify_hostname`, `bunnify_local_dev_mode`, and the debug toggles via the Settings API; exposes static helpers `is_local_dev_mode_enabled()` and `is_debug_enabled_for_category()`. | `admin_menu`, `admin_init` |
| **RESTController** | `Controller/RESTController.php` | **No-op stub.** Registers three REST filters that return their input unchanged behind "For now" comments. Slated for removal — see §8. | `rest_request_before_callbacks`, `rest_after_insert_attachment`, `rest_request_after_callbacks` |

### ImageController vs ContentController — the split

The two rewriters cover **disjoint** rendering paths and coordinate via a heuristic:

- `ImageController` intercepts WordPress' *structured* attachment APIs (`wp_get_attachment_image*`,
  `image_downsize`, `wp_calculate_image_srcset`). It knows the attachment ID and requested size, so
  it can compute exact dimensions and aspect ratios.
- `ContentController` rewrites *already-rendered HTML strings* (`the_content`, blocks, widgets) where
  there is no attachment context — it parses each `<img>` and resolves the ID from the `src` URL. Its
  `is_attachment_image()` check (`ContentController.php:355`) skips images bearing `wp-post-image` (a
  post thumbnail already handled by `ImageController`) to avoid double-processing.

---

## 4. Libraries

Two static-heavy libraries under `src/php/Library` hold the logic the controllers call. Both use
`declare(strict_types=1)`.

### URLTransformer — the CDN URL builder

`URLTransformer` (`Library/URLTransformer.php`) turns a local upload URL (or an attachment ID) into a
Bunny URL. Responsibilities:

- **Instance path** — `transform_url( $image_url, $args, $scheme )`: validates the URL, confirms it is
  a local upload (`is_local_upload_url()`), then builds `https://{hostname}{path}?{query}` via
  `build_cdn_url()` / `build_query_string()`. Applies the `bunnify_skip_for_url`,
  `bunnify_pre_image_url`, `bunnify_pre_args`, and `bunnify_post_image_url` filters. The constructor
  validates and sanitizes the hostname and throws `InvalidArgumentException` if it is empty/invalid.
- **Static path** — `get_cdn_url_by_id( $attachment_id, $args, $scheme )`: the workhorse the image
  and content pipelines call. It resolves the **true original** URL (stripping `-scaled`, avoiding
  WordPress' dimension-suffixed derivatives) via `get_true_original_url()` and builds the CDN URL from
  that path so Bunny always pulls the full-resolution original and resizes on the fly. Backed by a
  lazily-initialised static singleton (`init_static_cdn()`, `URLTransformer.php:444`).
- **Query args** — `build_query_string()` maps `width`/`height`/`crop` to Bunny's params and passes
  through any additional scalar transform args (e.g. `quality`, `format`).
- **Guards** — `validate_image_url()` (extension allow-list, not-already-CDN), `is_cdn_url()`
  (hostname match or presence of CDN query params), and `image_exists_locally()` (used by local-dev
  mode to bypass rewriting for files present on disk).

### ImageProcessor — attachment lookup, dimensions, caching

`ImageProcessor` (`Library/ImageProcessor.php`) is the read/parse/cache half:

- `get_attachment_id_from_url()` — reverse-maps a URL to an attachment ID, with fallbacks that strip
  `-1024x684` dimension suffixes and try the `-scaled` variant; results cached (see §6).
- `parse_dimensions_from_filename()` — extracts `WxH` from a derivative filename.
- `get_image_sizes()` — collects registered WordPress sizes (core + theme/plugin) with static memo.
- `attachment_url_to_postid()`, `get_cached_original_url()`, `get_attachment_cache_ttl()` — the
  cached DB-lookup helpers and the smart-TTL policy that the rest of the plugin shares.

**The split:** `URLTransformer` *writes* CDN URLs; `ImageProcessor` *reads and resolves* attachment
data (ID ↔ URL, dimensions, registered sizes) and owns the TTL policy. `URLTransformer` delegates its
attachment lookups and TTLs back to `ImageProcessor` (e.g. `URLTransformer::get_attachment_id_from_url()`
and `get_true_original_url()` both call into `ImageProcessor`), keeping URL construction and WordPress
data access on opposite sides of the boundary.

## 5. How a request flows

Example: a template calls `wp_get_attachment_image( $id, 'large' )`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Theme as Theme / wp_get_attachment_image()
    participant WP as WordPress core
    participant IC as ImageController
    participant UT as URLTransformer (static)
    participant IP as ImageProcessor

    Theme->>WP: wp_get_attachment_image($id, 'large')
    WP->>IC: image_downsize filter → filter_image_downsize()
    IC->>IP: get_image_sizes() / parse size 'large'
    IC->>UT: get_cdn_url_by_id($id, {width,height})
    UT->>IP: get_attachment_cache_ttl($id)
    UT-->>IC: https://cdn.example.com/wp-content/uploads/…jpg?width=…&height=…
    WP->>IC: wp_calculate_image_srcset → filter_srcset_array()
    IC->>UT: get_cdn_url_by_id() per srcset source
    WP->>IC: wp_get_attachment_image (HTML) → filter_attachment_image()
    IC->>IC: WP_HTML_Tag_Processor rewrites src / width / height / srcset
    IC-->>Theme: <img src="cdn…" srcset="cdn… 300w, cdn… 600w" …>
```

Text summary:

1. **`image_downsize`** → `ImageController::filter_image_downsize()` resolves the requested size to
   width/height (registered size, `[w,h]` array, or `16:9-768` custom parse), then calls
   `URLTransformer::get_cdn_url_by_id()` and returns `[cdn_url, width, height, false]`.
2. **`wp_calculate_image_srcset`** → `filter_srcset_array()` rewrites each responsive source to a CDN
   URL, computing per-descriptor dimensions from the original's aspect ratio.
3. **`wp_get_attachment_image`** → `filter_attachment_image()` is the final HTML pass: it parses the
   emitted `<img>` with `WP_HTML_Tag_Processor` and rewrites `src`, `width`, `height`, and `srcset`
   (or generates a srcset/sizes if none exist).
4. Content not produced by these functions (inline `<img>` in `the_content`, blocks, galleries,
   widgets) is handled separately by **`ContentController`** on `the_content`/`render_block`/etc.
5. Every path bottoms out at `URLTransformer::get_cdn_url_by_id()` → true-original resolution →
   `https://{bunnify_hostname}{path}?{args}`.

Short-circuits at each stage: admin context (unless opted in), `BUNNIFY_DISABLE`, the
`bunnify_skip_for_url` / `bunnify_override_*` filters, already-CDN URLs, and **local-dev mode** (file
exists on disk ⇒ return the original untouched).

---

## 6. Configuration

- **`bunnify_hostname`** — the only functional switch. Empty ⇒ every CDN-init guard returns early and
  the plugin passes URLs through untouched. Set on **Media → BunnyCDN** (e.g. `cdn.example.com`).
- **`bunnify_local_dev_mode`** — when on, rewriting is bypassed for any image that exists on the local
  filesystem (`URLTransformer::image_exists_locally()`), so local originals render while
  CDN-only assets still rewrite. Overridable per-request via the `bunnify_local_dev_mode_check` filter.
- **`BUNNIFY_DISABLE`** (constant) — hard kill switch checked in `transform_url()` / `cdn_url()`.
- **Debug logging** — `bunnify_debug_enabled` plus per-category toggles (`bunnify_debug_url_transformation`,
  `…_image_processing`, `…_srcset_generation`, `…_content_filtering`, `…_local_dev_mode`, `…_performance`).
  Logs are written to `wp-content/uploads/bunnify-debug.log` and only emitted when a page is loaded with
  `?bunnify_debug=1`. See [LOGGING.md](LOGGING.md).
- **`bunnify_enabled`** — the master switch, read via `SettingsController::is_enabled()` and checked
  in the CDN bootstrap paths (`CdnClientTrait::init_cdn()`, `URLTransformer::init_static_cdn()`) and
  the resource-hints controller. A missing option means **enabled** (installs configured before the
  switch was wired up keep rewriting); only an explicitly saved falsy value disables the plugin. A
  configured `bunnify_hostname` is still required for anything to rewrite.

`uninstall.php` removes all `bunnify_*` options.

---

## 7. Caching strategy

All caching goes through the WordPress object cache in a single group, **`bunnify_frontend`**, so a
persistent backend (Redis/Memcached) makes it durable across requests; without one it is per-request.

Two layers, with **smart, age-based TTLs** (older attachments change less, so they cache longer):

- **`Base\Traits\CachingTrait`** (`src/php/Base/Traits/CachingTrait.php`) — used by the controllers.
  Wraps `wp_cache_*` and caches attachment metadata (`get_cached_attachment_metadata()`), attachment
  URLs, true-original URLs, and filesystem checks. Its TTL ladder
  (`get_attachment_cache_ttl()`, `CachingTrait.php:238`) is 5 min → 1 hour → 1 day → 1 week based on
  attachment age (newer → shorter).
- **`Library\ImageProcessor`** (also `use`s `CachingTrait`) — owns the *lookup* caches:
  URL→ID (`get_attachment_id_from_url`), `attachment_url_to_postid`, and original-URL caches, keyed by
  `md5()` of the URL. Its own `get_attachment_cache_ttl()` uses a longer ladder for these expensive DB
  lookups: 7 days (recent) → 30 → 60 → 120 days (very old / not-found), with a 5-minute floor. Negative
  results are cached as the sentinel string `not_found`.

`URLTransformer::get_true_original_url()` caches the resolved original per attachment
(`bunnify_true_original_url_{id}`) using `ImageProcessor`'s TTL. `clear_attachment_cache()` /
`clear_all_bunnify_caches()` (group flush) exist for invalidation.

---

## 8. Public filter surface

Bunnify's contract with themes and other plugins is its `bunnify_*` hooks — the **only** supported
extension points. The full list with signatures and examples lives in **[HOOKS.md](HOOKS.md)**.
Highlights:

- **`bunnify_url`** — direct URL rewrite entry point (`apply_filters('bunnify_url', $url, $args, $scheme)`).
- **`bunnify_skip_for_url`**, **`bunnify_pre_image_url`**, **`bunnify_pre_args`**,
  **`bunnify_post_image_url`** — the transform pipeline hooks.
- **`bunnify_allow_non_upload_url`** — opt in URLs outside `wp-content/uploads`.
- **`bunnify_local_dev_mode_check`** — override local-dev detection per request.
- **`bunnify_override_image_downsize`**, **`bunnify_replace_attachment_srcs`** — short-circuit the
  image pipeline.
- **`bunnify_processing_attachment_image`** (action) — fires as `filter_attachment_image()` runs.

The framework also exposes `base_pre/post_controller_*` filters around controller setup.

---

## 9. Architectural debt

Known rough edges, each with a design blueprint under `docs/blueprints/enhancements/`:

- **No DI / duplicated CDN init.** The "read `bunnify_hostname`, guard on empty, `new URLTransformer`"
  dance is copy-pasted across `CDNController::init_cdn()`, `ContentController::init_cdn()`, and
  `URLTransformer::init_static_cdn()` (a static singleton), with stray `get_option()` reads elsewhere.
  A single injected CDN service is proposed in
  [blueprints/enhancements/di-container-service-layer/README.md](blueprints/enhancements/di-container-service-layer/README.md).
- **REST stub.** `RESTController` registers three no-op filters on every REST request. The
  recommendation is removal — see
  [blueprints/enhancements/rest-controller-completion/README.md](blueprints/enhancements/rest-controller-completion/README.md).
- **Hand-written settings.** `SettingsController` hand-codes ~11 near-identical field callbacks with no
  `sanitize_callback`. A data-driven schema is proposed in
  [blueprints/enhancements/data-driven-settings/README.md](blueprints/enhancements/data-driven-settings/README.md).
- **Un-standardised `Base` framework.** `src/php/Base` is excluded from PHPCS/PHPStan, lacks
  `strict_types`, and is duplicated in the downstream consumer (now diverging: the recursive
  trait-detection fix in `Application` has only landed here). See
  [blueprints/enhancements/base-framework-standards/README.md](blueprints/enhancements/base-framework-standards/README.md).
- **Related:** test coverage
  ([blueprints/enhancements/full-test-coverage/README.md](blueprints/enhancements/full-test-coverage/README.md))
  and the wp.org runtime autoloader path
  ([blueprints/enhancements/wporg-runtime-autoloader/README.md](blueprints/enhancements/wporg-runtime-autoloader/README.md)).
